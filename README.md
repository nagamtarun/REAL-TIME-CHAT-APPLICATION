A real-time chat application allows users to communicate instantly via text messages.
Messages sent by one user appear immediately to all other connected users without refreshing the page.
This is achieved using WebSockets, a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication between client and server.
In this project, we use Socket.IO, a JavaScript library that simplifies WebSocket implementation.
